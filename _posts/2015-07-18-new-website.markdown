You might have already noticed that [Springbeats' website][sbweb] doesn't exactly
look like before.

We've switched servers and at the same time decided to redo the design so that
it's more coherent with what's on the blog.

Also, we were not showing properly the work we did as [JUCE experts][sbjuce].
Now if you want to hire us for custom development, you can see what we did before
(only the projects we didn't sign an NDA for though, unfortunately), and you have
a clear contact form.

Besides, mobile navigation wasn't very good with the previous version. Now
this should be much more readable!

For the tech guys out there, there will be a post on my dev blog about how
it was deployed with [docker-machine][docker machine] and
[docker-compose][docker compose] :).

Let us know on [facebook][sbfb] or [twitter][sbtwt] what you think of the upgrade!
