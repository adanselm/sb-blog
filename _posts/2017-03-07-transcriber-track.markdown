For a couple of months now, [Soundtoolz.com][soundtoolz] has been selling
[TranscriberTrack][tt], a Windows and Mac app developed by **Springbeats**
that facilitates the work of musicians wishing to learn and transcribe
their favorite songs.

## It lets you load any song you like by simply dragging the file onto the app:

## You can then use the integrated 8-band EQ to emphasize the instrument you want to listen to specifically:

## Record yourself while looping on a specific section:

Tapping the tempo lets you align the loop on the song's bars.

## Slow it down while keeping the correct pitch and record yourself at lower speed:

Speeding the playback back up also adapts the speed of your recorded performance.

## Apply VSTs to your recorded track to match the original performance:
