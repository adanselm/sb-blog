Last November, we attended the [Audio Developer Conference][adc16] in Goldsmiths
University of London. It is an event organized by the company behind the JUCE
library that we, at Springbeats, use to develop audio applications for our
clients and for ourselves. Two days of conference on topics related to audio
programming, right in central London, which, by the way, is a pretty cold
place to live in ;)

## Clear trends

If you look at the [program][adc-program], you'll probably notice for yourself
the trends of this year:

  * Machine Learning
  * Embedded systems
  * Embracing new techs / practices / standards

It is funny to see how machine learning invades every field, even sound related
ones where you might not expect it. The demos that were made looked pretty
convincing so I'm guessing many companies will start integrating this type
of technologies in their products in the coming year.

Embedded and mobile systems seem to have reached a more mature state, where
the latency and power restrictions no longer hinder the possibilities in terms
of mobile audio.

Not really a new trend, but we also see the expressiveness of controllers
improve over the years. Roger Linn stated it in his talk, and the products
from ROLI are a good demonstration as well.

## Overall impression

The organization was flawless, and the event gathered twice more attendants
than last year, with all the big names of the industry, and many many
small developers like us.

My general impression of the talks was that they did not go into enough
technical details for my taste, probably because of the allowed duration for each talk.
I heard from small developers, and it was my impression too, that there was
not much material for plugin developers.

But in the end, I'm curious to see how it evolves, and will want to go back
next year for sure :) .

Part of the talks are now [available on YouTube][adc-youtube].
