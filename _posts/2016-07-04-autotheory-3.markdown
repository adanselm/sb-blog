Music theory can be a little bit scary for learning musicians and producers.
The goal of [AutoTheory][mozaicbeats] has always been to make it more
accessible to everyone. In this quest for accessibility, the teams behind
AutoTheory designed a new interface for the app, that we brought to life
here at Springbeats.

AutoTheory 3's new UI is now fully vectorized, which means its controls are
crispier and its window can be scaled even to full screen display if you need to.

The concept is still the same: a standalone application that makes the bridge
between your MIDI controller and your Digital Audio Workstation, or any audio
software that accepts MIDI input, transforming the MIDI notes on the fly.

It adds a handful of new features:

* Illustrated dialog to help you configure your DAW to work with AutoTheory
* New Scales! Now totalling an impressive total of 35 scales to choose from :)
* New chord types
* New Arpeggiator mode in Melody Lock
* Save current preset
* Piano display at the bottom to see the notes that are being generated
* ... plus the usual bug fixes

Check out this presentation video unveiling the new user interface:

You can buy it directly from [the official website][at purchase] or from
[plugin boutique][plugin boutique].

But wait, there is more!
If you would like to try things out before buying, we also made a trial version.
It has an integrated sampler, which means you don't even have to configure
anything, since it already includes sounds (which will
automatically be downloaded the first time you run it). It is the perfect way
to discover the different scales and playing modes, without worrying about
anything technical.

You can download the trial version from the [downloads page][at purchase].
